

Install the Service with NSSM
Download NSSM: Go to the NSSM website and download the latest version. Extract the nssm.exe file (from the win64 folder) 
into a memorable location, like C:\NSSM.

Open PowerShell as an Administrator.

Navigate to the NSSM folder: cd C:\NSSM

Run the NSSM installer GUI: ./nssm.exe install MyChatBot

Configure the Service: A window will pop up.

Application Tab:

Path: Browse to your virtual environment's python.exe. It will be something like E:\Projects\Taskbot_Assistant\venv\Scripts\python.exe.

Startup directory: Browse to your project's source folder, E:\Projects\Taskbot_Assistant\src.

Arguments: This is the crucial part. Enter main.py --no-interactive.

Click the Install service button.

Start Your Service: In the same Administrator PowerShell, run: ./nssm.exe start MyChatBot

That's it! Your bot is now running as a permanent Windows service. It will start on boot and run silently in the background, 
listening for webhooks and firing reminders, without you needing to do anything. You can check the chatbot.log file to see its activity.


to restart server 
./nssm restart MyChatBot
